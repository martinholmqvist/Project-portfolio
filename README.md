# Master Student in Statistics and Data science

#### For the following project I have used the software R.

## Projects
### Improving House Price Prediction Models: Exploring the Impact of Macroeconomic Features
This thesis investigates if house price prediction models perform better when adding macroe- conomic features to a data set with only house-specific features

### A comparative analysis of ridge and lasso regularization in predicting student performance
In this project me and Max Hansson compared the performance in predicting students grade using penalized regression models where we had high multicollinearity and many covariates as input data.

### A timeseries analysis on predicting covid cases
In this project we tried to create an ARIMA model that would predict the amount of covid cases per week and compared these models to a naive model.
